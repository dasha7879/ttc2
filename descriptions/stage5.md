# üöÄ Stage 5: Decentralized Management

## Objective
The final stage of the Tact Smart Challenge introduces a mechanism for decentralized management within the social network, enabling users to participate in governance through voting. The goal of this stage is to empower the community by allowing it to make collective decisions about the distribution of rewards and other key aspects of the network.

## Implementation of Voting Mechanism

### Master Contract Enhancements
- Integrate a voting system within the master contract to manage proposals regarding the reward distribution.
- The voting system should allow only admin to initiate a vote on a proposal, which then opens a 24-hour voting window.

### Voting Process
- **Initiating a Vote:** Any user can submit a proposal for a change. Upon submission, the proposal is assigned a unique identifier, and a 24-hour countdown begins.
- **Casting Votes:** Users vote "For" or "Against" a proposal. The power of each user's vote is equal to each other.
- **Counting Votes:** After the voting period ends, the votes are tallied. If the number of "For" votes surpasses the "Against" votes, the proposal is considered approved.
- **Implementing Changes:** Approved proposals are then implemented. For changes to the reward distribution, the new values becomes active immediately following approval.
- **NOTEÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è:** Situations with falsification of votes from one person do not need to be validated. This will simplify the task and focus on the main idea.

### Security and Verification
- Implement safeguards to ensure that only legitimate users can participate in the voting process.

## Development Recommendations

### Tools and Resources
- Leverage smart contract testing frameworks to simulate the voting process and evaluate its integrity and resilience against various attack vectors.
- Consider engaging with the community to gather feedback on the proposed voting mechanism and its potential impact on network governance.

### Testing
- Test the voting system thoroughly to ensure that it accurately counts votes, adheres to the designated voting period, and correctly implements approved proposals.
